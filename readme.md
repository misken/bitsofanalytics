# Bits of analytics

This is the content repo for my blog. The blog itself is hosted at
[https://misken.github.io/](https://misken.github.io/). This blog
replaces my [hselab.org](https://hselab.org/) blog whiich I'm in the process of retiring.

This new blog has the same focus, just a different set of static blogging tools.

* posts written in restructuredText, markdown and Jupyter notebooks,
* [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) used as the website creation engine,
* the [ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Sphinx extension provides blogging features to Sphinx,
* hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
