   hselab.org has moved
   

First Post at new blogging site
================================

I've moved hselab.org to this new site. It's hosted by GitHub Pages.

Reasons for moving and overhauling the underlying technology:

- been contemplating moving my blog to a Sphinx powered site
- the `ablog Sphinx extension <https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ makes blogging with Sphinx easy
- my static site doesn't need all the bells and whistles of most web hosting platforms
- want to build a more automated workflow for blogging by taking advantage of GitHub pages and actions

I was inspired by Chris Holdgraf's post on `blogging with Sphinx <https://predictablynoisy.com/posts/2020/sphinx-blogging/>`_ and my reasons
are similar to his.

For now I'm using the default ``alabaster`` Sphinx theme used by ablog but
will likely play around with other themes once I get my content ported.
