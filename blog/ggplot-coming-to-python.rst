   Can you use ggplot in Python?

ggplot coming to Python?
=========================

When doing analytics in Python, I use matplotlib for plotting and when
using R, it's ggplot2. I like them both. However, the `Grammar of
Graphics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson>`__ underlying
ggplot2 has a certain appeal to me and `Hadley Wickham keeps doing
amazingly great stuff in the R world <http://had.co.nz/>`__. So, it's
quite exciting to hear that the folks at `Yhat <http://yhathq.com/>`__
have taken a shot at bringing ggplot graphics to Python. Check it out at
http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/ggplot-for-python.html. Now if only Excel
had some ggplot goodness ... sigh. BTW, link at the bottom of the Y-hat
post has a nice bit on `when to use R vs when to use
Excel <http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1029-when-to-use-excel-when-to-use-r/>`__.
