Create sequence of ggplots and send to pdf
===========================================

See my previously posted tutorial `Getting started with R (with plyr and ggplot2) 
for group by analysis <http://hselab.org/getting-started-R-group-by.html>`__. 
At the end of that tutorial we did some facet plots to show a bunch of histograms. 
What if we wanted to do a sequence of plots instead and save each of them to separate PDFs?

Check out my approach at `http://rpubs.com/misken/ggplot2-pdfs <http://rpubs.com/misken/ggplot2-pdfs>`__.
